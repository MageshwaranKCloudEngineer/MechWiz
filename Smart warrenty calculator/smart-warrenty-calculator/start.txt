Step 1: System Architecture Design
Your project consists of:

Frontend Application (React.js)

Users input product details.
Displays warranty reminders and claim history.
Allows document uploads.
Backend Web Service (Django/FastAPI/Flask/Node.js)

Stores and manages warranty data.
Sends notifications.
Handles API integration.
Database (AWS DynamoDB/PostgreSQL)

Stores product and warranty data.
External APIs Integrated
âœ… Vehicle Service Locator API (your API)
âœ… Warranty Calculator API (classmateâ€™s API)
âœ… Notification API (Twilio/SendGrid for reminders)
âœ… Cloud Storage API (AWS S3 for document storage)
âœ… Optional: Manufacturer Warranty Validation API

Step 2: Define API Endpoints
1. Vehicle Service Locator API (Your API)
GET /service-centers?location={city}&product={category} â†’ Returns nearby service centers.
GET /service-center/{id} â†’ Fetches service center details.
POST /request-appointment â†’ Books an appointment.


2. Warranty Calculator API (Classmate's API)
POST /check-warranty â†’ Checks if a product is still under warranty.
GET /warranty-terms/{product_id} â†’ Retrieves warranty details.


3. Notification API (Public API)
POST /send-notification â†’ Sends SMS/email reminders.
POST /subscribe-notifications â†’ Users opt-in for reminders.


4. Cloud Storage API (AWS S3)
POST /upload-warranty-doc â†’ Uploads invoice/warranty proof.
GET /retrieve-doc?user={id}&product={id} â†’ Fetches stored documents.


5. Optional: Manufacturer Warranty Validation API
GET /validate-warranty?serial={product_serial_number} â†’ Checks product warranty.


Step 3: Backend Development (FastAPI/Django/Node.js)
I'll set up the backend structure first using FastAPI (or another framework you prefer). Letâ€™s create an initial backend scaffold. ðŸš€

I'll generate the FastAPI backend project with essential routes now.

Smart Warranty Backend
I've created the FastAPI backend structure with: âœ… Warranty Check API
âœ… Service Center Lookup
âœ… Notification API
âœ… File Upload to AWS S3

Next steps:

Database Integration (PostgreSQL/DynamoDB)
Authentication (JWT/OAuth)
CI/CD Deployment (AWS Lambda/EC2)
Would you like me to start with database integration next? ðŸš€
